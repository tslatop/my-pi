Keep agents aligned with your local coding standards before bad
commands run. `pi-coding-preferences` turns workflow preferences—like
using `rg` instead of `grep`—into lightweight guardrails that nudge
the model toward the project’s conventions.

It ships with default workflow preferences. Add user preferences at
`~/.pi/agent/coding-preferences.json` and project preferences at
`.pi/coding-preferences.json`; when either file exists, configured
rules are loaded instead of the built-in defaults.

```json
{
	"rules": [
		{
			"name": "no-npm",
			"toolNames": ["bash"],
			"target": "command",
			"pattern": "^npm\\\\b",
			"reason": "Use pnpm in this repo."
		}
	]
}
```

Rule targets are `command`, `path`, or `input`. Patterns are
JavaScript regular expressions.

```bash
pi install npm:@spences10/pi-coding-preferences
```

This is opt-in: installing the package globally applies it to your Pi
sessions, but projects and downstream users do not inherit it unless
they install the package.

## Development

Package scripts build transitive workspace dependencies first, then
run local tools through Vite+ with `vp exec`.

```bash
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-coding-preferences run check
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-coding-preferences run test
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-coding-preferences run build
```
