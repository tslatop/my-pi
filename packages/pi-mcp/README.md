Bring your MCP servers into Pi as first-class agent tools. `pi-mcp`
discovers configured servers, exposes their tools safely, and keeps
large MCP responses manageable through Pi’s context sidecar
integration.

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:@spences10/pi-mcp
```

Local development from this monorepo:

```bash
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-mcp run build
pi install ./packages/pi-mcp
# or for one run only
pi -e ./packages/pi-mcp
```

## Configuration

The extension loads MCP server definitions from `mcp.json` files in
global and project locations.

A typical project `mcp.json` looks like:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"sqlite": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "mcp-sqlite-tools", "./data.db"]
		}
	}
}
```

Global MCP config is loaded automatically. Project-local `mcp.json` is
untrusted by default because stdio servers can spawn local commands.
Interactive runs prompt before loading it; headless runs skip it
unless `MY_PI_MCP_PROJECT_CONFIG=allow` is set. Allow-once mode loads
project MCP tools but suppresses rich tool descriptions and schema
prose so untrusted server metadata cannot act as prompt injection. Use
`MY_PI_MCP_PROJECT_CONFIG=trust` to trust and remember the current
repo until its `mcp.json` hash changes and expose full metadata, or
`MY_PI_MCP_PROJECT_CONFIG=skip` to force-disable project MCP config.

Stdio MCP servers receive a restricted child-process environment by
default: baseline shell variables plus explicit per-server `env`
values. Use `MY_PI_MCP_ENV_ALLOWLIST=NAME,OTHER_NAME` or the shared
`MY_PI_CHILD_ENV_ALLOWLIST` to pass selected ambient variables
through.

Servers are not connected at session startup by default. Use
`/mcp connect <server>` or set `MY_PI_MCP_EAGER_CONNECT=1` to connect
and discover tools eagerly.

Server tools are registered as Pi tools using this naming format:

```text
mcp__<server>__<tool>
```

For example, a `sqlite` server tool named `execute_read_query`
becomes:

```text
mcp__sqlite__execute_read_query
```

## Commands

```text
/mcp                         # open the TUI server manager
/mcp manage                  # same as /mcp
/mcp list
/mcp enable <server>
/mcp disable <server>
/mcp connect [server|all]
/mcp backup                  # backup global + project MCP config
/mcp restore [backup-file]   # restore from picker or filename/path
/mcp profile list
/mcp profile save [name]
/mcp profile load [name] [global|project]
/mcp profiles                # saved profile list and actions
```

Use `/mcp` to open a modal home menu for server management, read-only
summaries, backups, and profiles. Toggles update the current session
and persist a `disabled`/`enabled` flag in the winning `mcp.json`
entry. Backups are written under `~/.pi/agent/mcp-backups/` and
restore global/project MCP config exactly as captured after modal
confirmation. Profiles are saved under `~/.pi/agent/mcp-profiles/` as
reusable merged server sets that can be saved with a modal input and
loaded into global or project MCP config after modal confirmation.

## What it does

- reads MCP server config
- connects to stdio or HTTP MCP servers on demand
- performs the MCP `initialize` handshake
- discovers tools via `tools/list`
- registers each discovered MCP tool with Pi
- forwards model tool calls to the MCP server
- truncates oversized MCP tool text output to the first 50 KiB or
  2,000 lines
- when `@spences10/pi-context` is enabled, stores oversized full
  output in the local SQLite context sidecar and returns a searchable
  source id
- otherwise saves truncated full output to a local
  `/tmp/my-pi-mcp-output-*.txt` file so it can be inspected with
  `read` or `rg`
- cleans up server processes on session shutdown

## Using from a custom harness

```ts
import mcp from '@spences10/pi-mcp';

// pass `mcp` as an ExtensionFactory to your Pi runtime
```

`my-pi` imports this package directly and enables it as the built-in
MCP extension.

## Development

Package scripts build transitive workspace dependencies first, then
run local tools through Vite+ with `vp exec`.

```bash
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-mcp run check
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-mcp run test
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-mcp run build
```
