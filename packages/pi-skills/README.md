Pi extension for managing and importing Agent Skills from Pi, Claude,
and plugin sources.

Maintained in the `my-pi` Vite+ workspace and tested with Vitest.

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:@spences10/pi-skills
```

Local development from this monorepo:

```bash
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-skills run build
pi install ./packages/pi-skills
# or for one run only
pi -e ./packages/pi-skills
```

## What it does

Pi already has native skill discovery. This package adds a management
layer for mixed skill ecosystems:

- discovers Pi-native skills in `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills`
  (default: `~/.pi/agent/skills`)
- discovers user-local Claude skills in `~/.claude/skills`
- discovers project skills in `.agents/*/SKILL.md`,
  `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`, and `.pi/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- discovers skills bundled inside installed Claude plugins
- imports plugin skills into Pi-native skill storage
- syncs imported skills when upstream plugin content changes
- provides a `/skills` command and interactive picker

Imported skills are copied into:

```text
$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/skills/<skill-name>
```

The `~/.claude` locations are intentional upstream discovery sources,
not Pi-managed state. Use `--no-skills` or `--untrusted` when sandbox
runs must not read user-local Claude skills/plugins.

Import metadata is stored beside each imported skill so sync can
detect local edits and upstream changes.

## Commands

```text
/skills
/skills enable <key|name|pattern>
/skills disable <key|name|pattern>
/skills import <key-or-name>
/skills sync <key-or-name>
/skills profile create <name>
/skills profile use <name>
/skills refresh
/skills defaults all-enabled
/skills defaults all-disabled
```

With a UI available, `/skills` opens a modal home menu for managing,
importing, syncing, refreshing, profile switching, and profile
baseline selection. The no-arg `import`, `sync`, and `defaults`
subcommands use modal pickers/forms in interactive mode. In headless
mode, use the subcommands directly.

## Skill enablement

The extension treats profiles as named skill sets. The active profile
contains include/exclude rules for skill names, keys, sources, or
paths; `*` wildcards are supported. Legacy top-level enablement is
migrated into the `default` profile on load.

The extension contributes enabled managed skill paths during Pi
resource discovery. Project skills are enabled by default when project
resources are allowed, and can still be excluded by profile rules.

Profiles can also be selected by context without hardcoding project
names in code. Example:

```json
{
	"contexts": [
		{
			"name": "client-workspace",
			"profile": "client-projects",
			"when": { "cwd": "~/repos/client-projects/*" }
		}
	],
	"profiles": {
		"default": { "include": [], "exclude": [] },
		"client-projects": {
			"extends": ["default"],
			"include": ["client-*", "project:*"],
			"exclude": []
		}
	}
}
```

In a custom harness such as `my-pi`, this can be combined with a
resource filter to enforce disabled skills. In vanilla `pi`, Pi's own
default skill discovery can still load skills from default locations,
so use `pi config` or settings filters when you need hard disable
semantics.

## Using from a custom harness

```ts
import skills, { create_skills_manager } from '@spences10/pi-skills';

// pass `skills` as an ExtensionFactory to your Pi runtime
const manager = create_skills_manager();
```

`my-pi` imports this package directly and uses
`create_skills_manager()` to enforce its built-in skill toggle
behavior.

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-skills run check
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-skills run test
pnpm --filter @spences10/pi-skills run build
```
