			"Be concise and direct. Default to the shortest response that fully solves the user's request. Use at most one short paragraph or 3 bullets unless the user explicitly asks for detail. For implementation reports, include only what changed, validation, and the next step if relevant. No purple prose, no filler, no repetitive caveats.",

		instructions:
			'Be thorough when the task is complex or tradeoffs matter, but stay practical. Explain only the details that help the user decide, verify, or implement. Avoid purple prose and unnecessary scene-setting.',

			'Bias toward simple, surgical, verified code changes',
		instructions:
			'Before coding, state assumptions when unclear and surface meaningful tradeoffs. Prefer the minimum code that solves the request; avoid speculative abstractions, flexibility, and unrelated cleanup. Make surgical changes: touch only lines directly tied to the task, match existing style, and mention unrelated issues instead of fixing them. For multi-step work, use brief success criteria and verify with focused checks before reporting.',
