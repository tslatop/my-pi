description: Use when verifying that published Pi packages install and load for normal users, including pi.dev package compatibility checks, release validation, Daytona sandbox tests, and package installability audits.
compatibility: Requires Node.js, pnpx, network access, ralph-town Daytona sandbox access, npm registry access, and vanilla Pi via @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent.

# Pi Package Sandbox Test

Verify published packages work for normal Pi users, independent of
`my-pi`.

## Procedure

1. From the repository root, enumerate `packages/*/package.json`.
2. Select only packages with a `pi` manifest; helper/internal packages
   without `pi` are not user-installable Pi packages.
3. For each selected package, compare local `package.json` version
   with `npm view <pkg> version`.
4. In a disposable Daytona sandbox via `pnpx ralph-town run`, use
   vanilla Pi only:
   ```bash
   pnpx @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
   ```
5. For each published npm version, verify both commands succeed:
   ```bash
   pnpx @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent install npm:<package>@<npm-version>
   pnpx @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent -e npm:<package>@<npm-version> --help
   ```
6. In the same clean sandbox config, install all selected packages
   together, then run:
   ```bash
   pnpx @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent list
   pnpx @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent --help
   ```

## Report Format

Report a compact table with:

- package name
- local version
- npm version
- install result
- ephemeral load result
- notes

Call out local/npm version drift separately. Version drift is not a
failure when it is explained by release timing, changesets, or
`minimumReleaseAge`; the user-facing check should use the published
npm version that normal Pi users can install.

## Failure Patterns

Treat these as failures unless explained by the sandbox environment:

- npm package cannot be resolved
- `pi install npm:<package>@<version>` exits non-zero
- `pi -e npm:<package>@<version> --help` exits non-zero
- startup output includes `Cannot find module`,
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, or
  `ReferenceError`
- packages pass alone but fail when installed together
