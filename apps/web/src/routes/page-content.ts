		'What is my-pi?',
		'my-pi is a Pi coding-agent distribution for terminal-first development. It wires MCP tools, LSP diagnostics, project skills, recall, context reduction, redaction, telemetry, and team mode into one install.',
	],
	[
		'Is my-pi different from Pi?',
		'Yes. Pi is the underlying coding-agent CLI and SDK. my-pi is the prewired distribution: it sets defaults, enables the extension stack, and publishes the same building blocks as reusable @spences10/pi-* packages.',
	],
	[
		'Can I install only part of my-pi?',
		'Yes. Most features are available as standalone packages. You can run the full distro with pnpx my-pi@latest, or install focused pieces such as @spences10/pi-lsp, @spences10/pi-mcp, @spences10/pi-context, or @spences10/pi-team-mode into an existing Pi installation.',
	],
	[
		'Does my-pi support scoped MCP servers?',
		'Yes. MCP servers can load globally or per project, with activation policies for cwd, GitHub org, and GitHub repo. That keeps org-specific search, browser, SQLite, or internal tools available only where they belong.',
	],
	[
		'Does my-pi include language-server tools?',
		'Yes. The LSP extension gives agents diagnostics, hover information, definitions, references, and document symbols through project language servers. The goal is safer edits: agents can inspect types and file-level errors before reporting that work is complete.',
	],
	[
		'How does my-pi reduce context usage?',
		'Large command output, reads, MCP responses, and LSP dumps can move into local searchable context. The agent gets a compact receipt, then searches or retrieves chunks only when needed. Current global context stats show 91.7% reduction and 10.6 MiB saved from chat.',
	],
	[
		'Does my-pi help protect secrets?',
		'Yes. my-pi includes output redaction, reminders to use secret-safe loading, and prompts around risky workflows. It is designed to steer agents away from pasting credentials into conversation context and toward tools that expose key names and command results without revealing secret values.',
	],
	[
		'Can my-pi run multiple agents?',
		'Yes. Team mode creates local RPC teammates, tracks tasks and dependencies, sends mailbox messages, shows status, and can spawn mutating teammates in isolated git worktrees. Use it to delegate research, review, tests, or implementation without losing coordination.',
	],
